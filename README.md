EMDR resources

A working lightbar app that is platform agnostic and simple to use. The
bilateral stimulation page is available here:
[emdr.epizy.com](https://emdr.epizy.com/).

## Usage

*Note: the terms* *websites, application, app, and software* *will be used interchangeably here to describe this EMDR light bar resource.* This app will work on any Internet enabled device using any modern web browser. The clinician can use it by going to the URL [https://emdr.epizy.com](https://emdr.epizy.com/) and then sharing their screen with their client. The new version does not work with Internet Explorer, the old version can still be found here [https://emdr.epizy.com/old](https://emdr.epizy.com/old)). Theoretically, any video-conferencing software will work although, the following have been tested:

-   Zoom

-   Attend Anywhere

-   Skype

It should be noted that older IOS devices, such as iPads, do not always support screen share facility. So, if the clinician or the client are using one of these devices with the app, it may not work.

### User Interface Usage

It is useful to note that you can reset the application by simply refreshing the page. To do this you can normally press `F5`, `Ctrl+R` (Windows) or `CMD+R` (MacOS), there is normally a button to do this as well.

At the start of the session, you can share the window in which you have this app open with your client. How this is done depends on the video-conferencing software that you are using. Some examples are found below. 

The settings in the grey box can be changed by clicking on them and they will automatically update.

#### Settings

| Name       | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Speed      | Speed changes the speed at which the ball moves across the screen, typical values range between 0.5 and 15. |
| Sets       | Sets changes the number of times the ball moves before it stops. This value can be set to any integer. Setting it to 1 would mean that the ball would move from the starting position to the opposite side of the screen and back once. |
| Timer      | Timer allows time to be changed to any required length in seconds. |
| Colour     | Colour changes the colour of the ball.                       |
| Background | Background changes the colour of the background.             |
| Size       | Size changes the size of the ball.                           |
| Direction  | Direction changes the vector on which the ball moves.        |

You can hide the settings box by clicking the *show/ hide button.*

To start and stop the ball, click the *start/stop button*.

##### Auto/Manual button  - NEW

*PLEASE NOTE there is a new Auto* setting in the Sets and Timer functions, which means that when both Sets and Timer are in the Auto mode, the ball will keep moving at the speed you chose until you press the start/press button.

### Using Screen Share

Open the URL in a **different web browser** to the main one that you are using in your video-conferencing software. On Windows, Microsoft Edge is recommended. Other web browsers which could be used include: Chrome, Firefox and Safari. 

1.  Click the screen share button in the video-conferencing software.

2.  A smaller window, or pop-up will then open.

3.  Click the button to share a specific window. It is generally best not to
    share your entire screen.

4.  Then select the browser window in which the application is located.

5.  Then click the okay button in the pop-up.

6.  The client should now be able to see the software.

To make sure that you can see the client’s face, there are 2 options depending on the software that you are using.

Firstly, in video-conferencing software such as Skype, when you minimise Skype, a small window with the client’s face will appear.

Secondly, in other applications, such as Attend Anywhere, you may have to have a smaller window with the application in it and overlay it on top of the video-conferencing software.
